>*The C++ Standard Library A Tutorial and Reference by Nicolai M. Josuttis. Figure 6.2. STL Container Types.*

| Containers | Type | Underlying data structure | Time complexity | Other |
|---|---|---|---|---|
[vector](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector) | sequence container | contiguous; dynamic array |1. Random access - constant ùìû(1) <br /> 2. Insertion or removal of elements at the end - amortized constant ùìû(1) <br /> 3. Insertion or removal of elements - linear in the distance to the end of the vector ùìû(n)  | The storage of the vector is handled automatically, being expanded and contracted as needed.
[deque](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/deque) <br />An abbreviation for ‚Äúdouble-ended queue.‚Äù| sequence container  | The elements of a deque are not stored contiguously: typical implementations use a sequence of individually allocated fixed-size **arrays**, with additional bookkeeping. | 1. Random access - constant O(1) <br /> 2. Insertion or removal of elements at the **end** or **beginning** - constant O(1) <br /> 3. Insertion or removal of elements - linear O(n) | The storage of a deque is automatically **expanded** and **contracted** as needed.
[array](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/array)|container |static array|Random access - constant O(1)|Have to specify its size at creation time.
[list](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/list)|sequence container|a doubly-linked list|1. Access to an arbitrary element takes linear time.<br />2. Insertion or removal of an element is fast at any position O(1).|Lists do not provide random access.
[forward_list](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/forward_list)|sequence container|a singly-linked list|1. Access to an arbitrary element takes linear time.<br />2. Insertion or removal of an element is fast at any position O(1).|Can‚Äôt search for an element and then delete it or insert another element in front of it.
